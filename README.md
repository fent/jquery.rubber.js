This is like the [elastic](http://unwrongest.com/projects/elastic/) plugin but for text fields. Text fields will stretch accordingly to fit their content. They will not get smaller than their original size and they will not grow longer than their parents, thus this doesn't break layouts.

Usage
------------

    $('input').rubber()
